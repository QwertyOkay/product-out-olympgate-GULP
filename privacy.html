          <p class="text">At olympgate.com, accessible from olympgate.com, one of our main priorities is the privacy of
            our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by
            olympgate.com and how we use it.</p>
          <p class="text">If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not
            hesitate to contact us.</p>
          <p class="text">We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using
            the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor
            and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users
            less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to
            promptly delete such data from our records.</p>
          <p class="text">When you visit the olympgate.com, we automatically collect certain information about your
            device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the installed
            cookies on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual
            web pages or products you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and how you interact
            with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.” Moreover, we
            might collect the personal data you provide to us (including but not limited to Name, Surname, Address,
            payment information, etc.) during registration to be able to fulfill the agreement.</p>
          <p class="text">Our top priority is customer data security, and, as such, we may process only minimal user
            data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the website. Information collected
            automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information
            regarding website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that it
            would identify any particular user of the system.</p>
          <p class="text">You can visit the website without telling us who you are or revealing any information, by
            which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some
            of the website’s features, or you wish to receive our newsletter or provide other details by filling a form,
            you may provide personal data to us, such as your email, first name, last name, city of residence,
            organization, telephone number. You can choose not to provide us with your personal data, but then you may
            not be able to take advantage of some of the website’s features.</p>
